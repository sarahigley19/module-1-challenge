# Module One Challenge
Accessiblity Code Refactor

## Description

The main goal for this project was to learn how to make code it more accessible without changing the overall design. I edited the HTML and CSS to complete this task. One of the hardest parts of this assignment was trying to not overdo it. I did end up changing the class names and consolidating the CSS, but I maybe didn't need to do as much as I did. 

One thing I am going to have to get used to is leaving comments. While I have experience with HTML and CSS in the past, I have never left comments before. This is something I hope to get better at as I continue with this class.
